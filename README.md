Simple, elegant and feature-rich CCTV/NVR for your cameras.

## About

motionEye is a popular frontend to the camera software called motion. This
add-on provides both, allowing you to add your camera's to your Hass.io setup.

motionEye is Open Source CCTV and NVR, that is elegant and really easy to use.
It can be used as a Baby Monitor, Construction Site Montage Viewer,
Store Camera DVR, Garden Security, and much more.

Some cool features of motionEye:

- Support for a ridiculous amount of cameras, including IP cams.
- Add multiple cameras by hooking up multiple motionEye instances together.
  For example, by using MotionEyeOS on a Pi Zero + Pi camera in your network.
- Supports uploading recording into Google Drive and Dropbox.
- motion detection, including email notification and scheduling.
- Can record continuously, motion, or timelapse, with retention settings.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "motionEye" add-on.
1. Start the "motionEye" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "motionEye" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button to open the web interface
1. Login with username "admin", without a password.
1. Edit your admin account with a secure password!

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "ssl": true,
  "certfile": "mycertfile.pem",
  "keyfile": "mykeyfile.pem"
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `motion_webcontrol`

Enables the motion webcontrol endpoint running on port `7999`.

:warning: MotionEye HTTP webcontrol **DOES NOT** support authentication
and **DOES NOT** support SSL! Enable this **ONLY** when you know what
you are doing! **NEVER, EVER** expose this port to the outside world!

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface of motionEye. Set it `true`
to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

## Known issues and limitations

- Local USB or Pi cameras are currently not supported yet. This is
  caused by a limitation of Hass.io. A request for a change has been made
  to make this possible in the future. motionEye(OS) allows you to use a second
  instance (e.g., a Pi Zero W) for those kinds of purposes.
